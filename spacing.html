        The first poetic form I fell in love with was the prose poem. 
        I immediately admired its defiance of the line. 
        As Charlotte Runcie says, 
        “[Prose poems] make a point of searching for where the definable limits 
        of poetry might be before stepping deliberately over them.”
      </p>

        This rebellion is part of the history of the form. 
        In an introduction to a prose poem writing prompt published at the Poetry Foundation,
        Wendy Chen writes,
        “In both its form and its focus on representing modernity, 
        prose poetry served as expression of resistance and rebellion against the past.”
